Hereâ€™s an explanation of **foreign keys** and **ON CASCADE** in SQL:

---

### **1. FOREIGN KEY**
- **Definition:**  
  A **foreign key** is a field (or a collection of fields) in one table that refers to the **primary key** in another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables.

- **Purpose:**  
  To maintain referential integrity between related tables.

- **Example Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
);
```
In this example:
- `DeptID` in the `Employees` table is a foreign key.
- It references the `DeptID` column in the `Departments` table.

---

### **2. ON CASCADE**
The `ON CASCADE` option is used with foreign keys to define how changes in the parent table affect the child table.

#### **Types of CASCADE Actions:**

1. **ON DELETE CASCADE**  
   - When a row in the parent table is deleted, the corresponding rows in the child table are automatically deleted.
   - **Example:**  
     If you delete a department from the `Departments` table, all employees belonging to that department will also be deleted from the `Employees` table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       EmpName VARCHAR(50),
       DeptID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID) ON DELETE CASCADE
   );
   ```

2. **ON UPDATE CASCADE**  
   - When a key in the parent table is updated, the corresponding foreign key values in the child table are automatically updated.
   - **Example:**  
     If the `DeptID` in the `Departments` table changes, all references to it in the `Employees` table will also update.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       EmpName VARCHAR(50),
       DeptID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID) ON UPDATE CASCADE
   );
   ```

---

### **3. Other ON DELETE / ON UPDATE Options**

1. **SET NULL**
   - When a parent row is deleted or updated, the foreign key in the child table is set to `NULL`.
   - **Example Syntax:**
   ```sql
   FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID) ON DELETE SET NULL
   ```

2. **SET DEFAULT**
   - When a parent row is deleted or updated, the foreign key in the child table is set to its default value (requires a default to be set).
   - **Example Syntax:**
   ```sql
   FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
   ```

3. **NO ACTION**
   - Prevents deletion or updating of the parent table row if there are matching rows in the child table. This is the default behavior if no action is specified.

   ```sql
   FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID) ON DELETE NO ACTION
   ```

4. **RESTRICT**
   - Similar to `NO ACTION`, but it ensures the check is immediate (not deferred).

### **4. Practical Example**

#### **Parent Table: Departments**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

#### **Child Table: Employees**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmpName VARCHAR(50),
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

#### **Insert Data:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES (101, 'HR'), (102, 'Finance');
INSERT INTO Employees (EmpID, EmpName, DeptID) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 101), (2, 'Bob', 102);
```

#### **Test Deletion:**
```sql
-- Deleting a department
DELETE FROM Departments WHERE DeptID = 101;

-- Result: The employee 'Alice' is also deleted.
```

#### **Test Update:**
```sql
-- Updating a department ID
UPDATE Departments SET DeptID = 200 WHERE DeptID = 102;

-- Result: Employee 'Bob' now has DeptID = 200.
```

### **Summary Table**

| Action Type       | Behavior                                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ON DELETE CASCADE` | Deletes child rows when the parent row is deleted.                  |
| `ON UPDATE CASCADE` | Updates child rows when the parent row is updated.                  |
| `SET NULL`         | Sets foreign key in the child table to `NULL` on delete/update.      |
| `SET DEFAULT`      | Sets foreign key in the child table to a default value.              |
| `NO ACTION`        | Prevents deletion/update of the parent row if it is referenced.      |
| `RESTRICT`         | Similar to `NO ACTION`, but ensures immediate enforcement.           |
